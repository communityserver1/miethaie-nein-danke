				<h1>Miethaie? Nein, Danke!</h1>
				<p>It’s no news that many of us are paying illegally high rent in Berlin. Luckily there are relatively good tenant protections and clear pathways to getting your rent lowered — it just takes a little bureaucracy ;)</p>
				<p>As neighbors who have successfully lowered their rent, we wanted to share what we learned to help anyone who’s considering going through the process. You can do it! ✰</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>➀ Check the Mietspiegel</h1>
				<p>The <span class="de">Mietspiegel</span>, or rent index, sets the legal rent limit in different localities. In general, cold rents can’t be higher than 10% above the local average. This law is known as the <span class="de">Mietpreisbremse</span>, or rent control.</p>
				<p>You can estimate your legal rent with the <a href="https://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/wohnen/mietspiegel/" target="_blank" class="de">Mietspiegelabfrage</a>, which will ask for neighborhood, building age, apartment size, and details about the apartment and building condition. This will help you get a sense of how much you could get your rent reduced by and if it’s worth it to pursue action.</p>
				<p>It’s important to know that there are a few exceptions to the rent control. One exception relates to renovation costs: if the landlord spent ⅓ of the cost of building a comparable new apartment on renovations, the apartment is exempt from rent control. This is a common defense used by landlords, but in practice it’s a difficult threshold to reach. So don’t be daunted even if you live in a totally renovated apartment! You could still very easily fall under rent control.</p>
				<p>Conny, the legal services company, has an <a href="https://conny.de/en/rent/rent-control/information" target="_blank">extensive list of exceptions</a> in case you’d like to know more, and once you’re a member, the people at the <span class="de">Mieterverein</span>, or Tenants’ Association, can always help you understand the details of your situation.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>➁ Join the Mieterverein</h1>
				<p>The <span class="de">Mieterverein</span> is your #1 support for any issues relating to your apartment rental. Once you join, they’ll help you navigate your case for lowering your rent (as well as any other issues you might have with your apartment) free of charge. To sign up, pick <a href="https://www.berliner-mieterverein.de/wir-ueber-uns/beratungszentren.htm" target="_blank">one of their branches</a> and call to schedule an appointment. Signing up costs 7.50 €, then 9 € each month (4,50 € if you’re low-income).</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>➂ Send a letter to your landlord</h1>
				<p>If the <span class="de">Mieterverein</span> thinks your case looks promising, send a letter to your landlord saying what your rent should be based on the <span class="de">Mietspiegel</span>. Your future back pay will be calculated from the date of this letter (not the beginning of your rental contract). The Mieterverein can take over communications with the landlord from here on. Your landlord may choose to settle, in which case you’ll get back pay and a new contract without going to court. Woo! *✧ﾟ</p>
				<p>While there’s no legal risk to starting this process, it's good to consider how your relationship with your landlord might be affected as you take this step. With large rental companies, who have different teams for, say, rental contract management and apartment fixes, you’re unlikely to experience any day-to-day consequences. With smaller landlords, this process might lead to a more acrimonious relationship in which the landlord tries to make things uncomfortable for you to try to push you out. The <span class="de">Mieterverein</span> can help you manage those situations as they arise, and rest assured: you can’t be kicked out of your apartment.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>➃ Go to court</h1>
				<p>If your landlord doesn’t settle, your case will go to court. If you were already a <span class="de">Mieterverein</span> member for at least three months before you entered into your rental contract, you’ll be covered by their legal insurance, so they’ll be able to represent you in court against your landlord free of charge.</p>
				<p>If you entered into your rental agreement before becoming eligible for their insurance, they’ll suggest continuing the case with <a href="https://conny.de/en" target="_blank">Conny</a>. Conny is risk-free: if you lose the case, you won’t pay anything; if you win, they’ll take five months of back pay from the lump sum you’ll get from your landlord at the end. This also means that if they take your case, you can consider it a good sign (though no guarantee!) that you’ll win.</p>
				<p>Whether the <span class="de">Mieterverein</span> or Conny is representing you in court, they’ll do everything for you, sending you updates and asking for your input along the way as needed. There’s nothing for you to do but wait… awhile :) If your landlord doesn’t settle, expect the whole process to take anywhere from 1.5 to 2.5 years.</p>
				<p>If you win your case, you’ll get a new rental contract and back pay as a lump sum. Ideally, your new rent will be 10% above the <span class="de">Mietspiegel</span>, as is legally allowed, but you may end up with something slightly higher depending on how the court case goes. Good luck!</p>
